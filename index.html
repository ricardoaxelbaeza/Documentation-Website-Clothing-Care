      <p>Caring for clothing items properly will extend their life.  This has important earth-friendly consequences. By cutting consumption of new clothing, we reduce our contribution to fashion’s carbon footprint and worldwide waste in landfills. But whether clothing is new or second-hand, an everyday item or a special heirloom, all clothing lasts much longer with some simple, basic maintenance. And, as an added bonus, saves money in the long run! </p>

      <p>Most garments often come with a label that contain instructions for how they should be washed. </p>
    
       <p>Getting the temperature and wash cycle right is important for seeing great laundry results and can even prevent damage to your clothes. <a href="https://tide.com/en-us/how-to-wash-clothes/how-to-do-laundry/how-to-read-laundry-symbols">Understanding the clothes washing symbols</a> can give you an idea for temperature, indicated by the number of dots in the tub of water symbol, whereas different cycle types are represented by a tub with one or two lines drawn under it. Of course, you’ll want to sort your clothing by type and color so that you’re using the appropriate wash cycle for each garment.</p>

      <p>Laundry detergents play a crucial role in keeping our clothes clean and fresh.There are a variety of detergents, to which some may have a specific purpose.</p>
       <p>Laundry detergents use different compounds, or surfactants, to remove stains from clothes. Powder detergents use alkylbenzene sulfonate to remove stains, while liquid detergents use alcohol ethoxylates. Liquid detergents use alcohol compounds because they are more stable in liquid form.

</p>
      <h3>Liquid Laundry Detergents:</h3>
      <p>Liquid detergents are popular because they effectively remove oil and grease stains. They can be applied directly to clothes for pre-treating spots. They work well in both cold and hot water washes and come in regular or concentrated formulas. Liquid detergents are ideal for everyday laundry and stain removal.</p>
       <h3>Powder Laundry Detergents:</h3>
       <p>Powder detergents are affordable, have a longer shelf life than liquid ones, and are effective at tackling tough dirt and stains (such as clay or mud). They’re also great for bulk purchases and storage. Powder detergents are suitable for general washes and heavy-duty cleaning.</p>
       <h3>Eco-Friendly and Specialized Detergents:</h3>
       <p>The demand for sustainable and skin-friendly products has led to eco-friendly detergents made with biodegradable ingredients. Detergents for sensitive skin are free from potential irritants, and those with odor or stain removers contain enzymes to tackle challenging laundry issues. These specialized detergents are ideal for environmentally conscious consumers and those with specific needs.</p>

        </li>

        <li>Washing your underwear and socks seperate from other clothing can be more sanitary.</li>
        <li>Some garments may need gentler wash cycles and cold water.</li>
        <li>Some garments may need a heavier wash cycle with hot water.

      <header>Washing Graphics</header>
      <p>One of the biggest issues with screen-printed graphics on clothing is that overtime, they often fade or crack. For those who would like to elongate the life of these graphics, wash them inside out. Doing so will minimize friction with other clothes inside the wash, as well as other pieces that may be on your washer and dryer. </p>
