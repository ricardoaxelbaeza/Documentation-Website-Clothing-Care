      <p>Laundry detergents play a crucial role in keeping our clothes clean and fresh.There are a variety of detergents, to which some may have a specific purpose.</p>
       <p>Remember to choose a detergent that aligns with your priorities and lifestyle. Whether it’s stain removal, convenience, or eco-friendliness, there’s a detergent type for everyone!</p>
      <h3>Liquid Laundry Detergents:</h3>
      <p>Liquid detergents are popular because they effectively remove oil and grease stains. They can be applied directly to clothes for pre-treating spots. They work well in both cold and hot water washes and come in regular or concentrated formulas. Liquid detergents are ideal for everyday laundry and stain removal.</p>
       <h3>Powder Laundry Detergents:</h3>
       <p>Powder detergents are affordable, have a longer shelf life than liquid ones, and are effective at tackling tough dirt and stains (such as clay or mud). They’re also great for bulk purchases and storage. Powder detergents are suitable for general washes and heavy-duty cleaning.</p>
       <h3>Eco-Friendly and Specialized Detergents:</h3>
       <p>The demand for sustainable and skin-friendly products has led to eco-friendly detergents made with biodegradable ingredients. Detergents for sensitive skin are free from potential irritants, and those with odor or stain removers contain enzymes to tackle challenging laundry issues. These specialized detergents are ideal for environmentally conscious consumers and those with specific needs.</p>

      <header>Sorting Your Laundry</header>
      <p>Sorting your laundry loads can be a beneficial step to your laundry routine as it can help for sanitary reasons or prevent unwanted accidents to your clothes.</p>

        </li>
        <li>Darker colored fabric can fade from hot water temperatures.</li>
        <li>Washing your underwear and socks seperate from other clothing can be more sanitary.</li>
        <li>Some garments may need gentler wash cycles and cold water.</li>

    <section class="main-section" id="washing_graphics">
      <header>Washing Graphics</header>
      <p>One of the biggest issues with screen-printed graphics on clothing is that overtime, they often fade or crack. For those who would like to elongate the life of these graphics, wash them inside out. Doing so will minimize friction with other clothes inside the wash, as well as other pieces that may be on your washer and dryer. </p>
